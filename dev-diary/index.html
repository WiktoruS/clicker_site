            <p>
                My name is Wiktor. I'm from Poland and I'm starting my adventure with coding. This is my first website that i made fully in almost 3hours. In the future i would use it
                for being main page of game that i gonna made in the near future. Perhaps you are interested in the history of the creation of this website. I have no idea what should 
                I do right now, i just have a little bit time to talk about it but I have not a good person whos would listen to It. That's the reason why I'm gonna talk about it there :).
                <br />
                So... yea. As i told my name is Wiktor. When i write this its Tuesday, 20th July 2021. I started to learning coding just few weeks ago, on start of July i guess.
                So this is my 3rd week of programming. I have written a LOT during this time and I've learned much more (i hope and i guess in one). My first pages were absolutely ugly -
                just a few paragraphs with no styles, no frames and without style :) Everyone did that, didn't they?
                <br />
                Of course I did nice sites too, especially one, but she was really in-back with technology. I'm not gonna act a man who knows everything about coding after just three weeks.
                Phi! I still know only that I don't know nothing. But coding gives me quiet. Gives me "my time" and creates "my space" between many other activities since day. I believe, 
                that good exercising gives the most so.... I exercise a lot with a hope that I will be a good programmer in the future. So to write first "site" concentrated on something 
                I've looked for topic that I likes and I know a lot about. Fell on warframe. I really love this game and I've got 400+ hours in it already so I know it a little bit. 
                That's it - i thought - I will code something about warframe.
                And I did it. I created a website where i putted some graphic content, nice background that i did in photoshop, simple menu etc. I even created a header containing 
                video that was autoplaying in loop when site was showed. It was nice, I can't say that it wasn't, but That was too Simple. After few days i decided to write new one 
                for a game that i gonna do in javascript probably (I'm starting learning javascript tommorow i guess if i will have enough time for it after work and meetings with my lovely girlfriend).
                <br /> 
            </p>
                <h1 class="in-text"> There we have to go back for a while, to a moment that i decided to learn coding...</h1>
                <p> I wanted to work from home since everyday of my life. I love a moment when everyone is hurrying up to the office and I'm doing a coffee while watching it, going 
                    straight to my "workplace" in my home. I even tried to write a game in C# without knowing C#, by unity. I didn't end it cause i had not enough time and motivation.
                    Then i accidentaly met one guy, i played League of Legends with him (hmm, yea XD), he said me about coding much more things, gave me tips that i didn't know about
                    before and inspired me one more time to learnt it. I am older now, I have some budget to spend on books, curses etc and well yeah, i started It. My dream was writing
                    games. I'm a player from i remember so that's one of the best things that I can do in my life. And I gonna do it, believe me.
